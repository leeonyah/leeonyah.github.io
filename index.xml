      <description>&amp;ndash; in filth it will be found
Deep in the dirtiest, most shameful crevices of life and thought are the answers to what plagues your mind. I think you can only find peace when you confront the nastiness of your own self, and that peace doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you will stop suffering, it just means you can wield your suffering as a weapon against the decay of the world. I know that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense, but it&amp;rsquo;s an idea I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to feel out, something I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with my whole life.</description>

      <description>Although published in 1919, Yeats&amp;rsquo; poem oozes a brooding contemporary tone that makes it one of my favorite poems. I love the grimly resigned criticism of modernity and frightening imagery that seems to comment directly upon the century we live in now.
