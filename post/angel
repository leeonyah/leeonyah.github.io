Multiocular O (ꙮ) is a rare glyph variant of the Cyrillic letter O.
This glyph variant can be found in certain manuscripts in the phrase
«серафими многоꙮчитїи» ("many-eyed seraphim"). It was documented by
Yefim Karsky[1] from a copy of Psalms[2] from around 1429, now found
in the collection[3] of the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius, and
subsequently incorporated[4] into Unicode as character U+A66E.
